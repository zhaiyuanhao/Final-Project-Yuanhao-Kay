## Background and exploratory analysis 

Our project explores the housing price trend in New York City, attempting to understanding what factors affect the sale prices most and developing a model that could effectively predict sale prices. We obtained the property sale data from the NYC Open Data using API. A quick exploration of the dataset informs that the average sale price per unit is around 400. We expected that housing prices is likely to be influenced by the safety level of the area that housing is located. Thus, we obtained the New York Policy Departmentâ€™s arrest data. We also included conventional factors in the Census dataset, including total population, total housing units, mean travel time to work, median household income, total households, and people in labor force, which we believe could depict the demographic status of a specific area.
-Method: we chose random forest instead of traditional regression model because of the possible non-linear relationship embedded in our features and also because it could effectively reduce the risk of overfitting.
